CHAT
=========================

Usage: chat [-p PORT -s SERVER]

Chat is a message-passing program that functions as both 
client and server. 

Running the program with no arguments starts server mode. 
Running the program with the port (-p) and server (-s) 
options starts it in client mode. The client mode will 
establish a socket connection to the given server on the 
given port. Then the client and server will each alternate
passing messages back and forth. The client will send 
first, and both client and server will block until
a message is received. Chat is terminated only using
Ctrl-C. 

ASSUMPTIONS:
- User knows basic terminal operations
- Port 55333 is available
- Client knows server will be listening on Port 55333
